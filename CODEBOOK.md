Notes on Measurements:
- As described in the "feautres_info.txt" file from the UCR HAR Dataset directory, these variables come from the "accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ". Note that the "t" denotes time and the XYZ are represent the X, Y, and Z axis from which the measurements are taken.
- The measurements recorded in this tidy dataset are the averages of each of these variables.
